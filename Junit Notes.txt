Intro & Junit architecture
    Junit is a java library used for unit testing
    unit testing is examining a small piece of software
    the goal is to assert the expected behavior and state
    Junit is part of Java API library
    Testing can be done with a debugging tool or print statements (this is limited)

    Junit provides automated testing and validation
        provide tools to unit test all aspects of the program
    
    unit testing is critical

    Why testing ?
        AUTOMATION, testing the code over a period of time
        The point is to verify on an ongoing basis that the code continues to work in the future.

    Why a testing framework ?
        in manual testing we always run, verify and alert messages in test cases,
        those repeated tasks are handled by the testing framework.

    Junit4 is slighlty old and doesn't support most of new java features
    Junit5 is a completly new thing
    
    Junit5 = Platform: Jupiter + Vintage + Ext
